## Adding a Dark/Ligh Mode to the React Facts site

This is one of the challeges from Scrimba, part of [React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) with Bob Ziroll. 

It included a design file from figma, and a code base. The main puprose of the challege was to add the dark/ligh mode functionality and apply our newly acquired knowledge about State in React.
